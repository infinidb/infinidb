# This file maps message ID's to message texts.
#
# When you need a new message text, you put it here and you add a detailed description
#  in the error message descriptions document in the Software docs folder
#
# The first token on a line must be the message ID. Everything else up to the the end of
#  the line is the message text. There must be exactly one tab character
#  separating the message id from the message text. The message text may
#  contain any character(s) except tab. The line must end with a single '\n'.
