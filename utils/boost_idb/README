These files are verbatim copies from Boost 1.55.0. Only the files
pertinent to InfiniDB are included, however. This should be all
of the thread, filesystem, regex and date_time libraries, as well
as most of the header-only code.

All of the code here retains its original copyright and is
included only for the convenience of compiling InfiniDB without
having to locate and install a Boost 1.55.0 development package.

See http://www.boost.org/ for a complete 1.55.0 source distribution.
